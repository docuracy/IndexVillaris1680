  "description": "<p><strong>INDEX VILLARIS:&nbsp;or, An Alphabetical Table of all the cities, market-towns, parishes, villages, and private seats in England and Wales</strong>&nbsp;was first published by John Adams in 1680. This dataset consists of a transcription of all 24,000 place-names listed in <em>Index Villaris</em>, together with the the symbols representing Adams&#39;s categorisation of each place and modern versions of the place-names and the counties and administrative hundred in which they lie or lay. It also comprises a transcription of the latitude and longitude recorded by Adams, and another set of coordinates generated by the application of a thin plate spline transformation calculated by matching some 2,000 place-names to the accurately-georeferenced CAMPOP Towns dataset.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset is being checked, corrected, and refined to include linkage to other geospatial references such as OpenStreetMap and Wikidata, and will in due course be made available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places\">Linked Places Format</a>.</p>"
